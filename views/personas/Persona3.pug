    h1(id='featureheading') Persona 3
    h2(id='personaformat') Marco, age 28, is a manager at a risqué novelty shop in the Oak River Mall in Madison, Wisconsin. Marco prides himself on his excellent customer service and believes that he will quickly move up to a higher management position at the mall before too much longer. He is a single male, living in a medium-sized apartment with his elderly cocker spaniel. Before entering his current position at the mall, Marco was pursuing a degree in accounting. Unfortunately, due to his inept mathematics skills, he was forced to drop out of school.  
    h2(id='personaformat') Outside of work, Marco enjoys spending time in software development and 3-D printing. Marco has a vast knowledge of computer technologies despite never having attended school for it. In recent months, he has been making money on the side by phishing the elders at the local nursing home. Sadly, he doesn’t see these actions as immoral. Marco’s of the mindset that “If they are stupid enough to click on these fraudulent emails, then they don’t deserve to have their money anyway.” To better perfect his future advances on these vulnerable individuals, Marco has been discovering new ways of breaching websites of all types. As a generous service, as he puts it, Marco has figured out ways of stealing memberships of other individuals from the top streaming sites and giving them to his friends. With the state of modern network security, Marco has no issue with continuing these unethical operations.
