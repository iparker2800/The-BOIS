    h1(id='featureheading') Scenario 2
    h2(id='personaformat') Haley, a 19-year-old movie fanatic, holds a biweekly movie discussion with a few friends from her school. In the past, she has always gone by word of mouth or scrolled through hundreds of movies on her favorite streaming platforms to find a movie that interests her. However, one of her friends, Grace, recently notified her of a new web app that allows her to easily find movies that are curated to her liking.  
    h2(id='personaformat') Excited, Haley investigates this new CineSearch app and is immediately bombarded with a plethora of intriguing movies. This week, she and her friends were going to be discussing comedy films that contain common cinematic themes. With little effort, Haley finds a “Themes” tab located at the top of the page within a “Filter by:” bar. Within this tab, she is able to find themes such as “Man vs Himself”, “Good vs Evil”, “Sacrifice”, and “Love”, with lists of movies in each category. She happily finds a coming-to-age movie that she thinks will be perfect for her discussion with her friends. She stars the movie, so that she can easily find it later, and proceeds to finish the remainder of her school assignments.  
    h2(id='personaformat') Later that evening, Haley reopens CineSearch and enters a “Favorites” tab that contains all the films that she had previously starred. After clicking on the movie she had chosen earlier that evening, an easily identifiable link redirects her to one of her streaming services where she happily watches the movie.  
    h2(id='personaformat') After watching the movie, Haley returns to the “Favorites” tab where she creates a personal rating of the movie, along with a few personal thoughts about the movie. Before closing up for the night, she shares her “Favorites” portfolio with her friend Grace so that she can see her comments on the movies she's favorited.
